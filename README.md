# My Course Project

This is my course project for Coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data

## Files in this repo
- README.md -- This file. It gives the contents of the repository & instructions to get the script works
- codebook.md -- A description for each variable in the tidy data set
- run_analysis.R -- A R script that prepares the tidy data set & can be used for later analysis

## Instructions

- Put run_analysis.R into C:\Users\yourname\Documents\R\
- In RStudio: setwd("C:\Users\yourname\Documents\R\"), followed by: source("run_analysis.R")
